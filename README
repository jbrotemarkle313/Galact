Galact is a simplified Galaga. 
When the user is ready to play the game enemies will randomly generate. The user must destroy the enemies with bullets to gain points.
If the user gets hit by an ememy or an enemy bullet the user will lose lives. Once the user loses all bullets or lives it is game over.
The user's final score will be displayed on the screen.
